# 🍕 Python Pizza Deliveries

A simple beginner-friendly Python project where users can order pizza by choosing size and toppings. The program calculates the total bill based on the user's choices.

---

## 📖 How It Works
1. The user selects a pizza size:  
   - **S (Small)** → $15  
   - **M (Medium)** → $20  
   - **L (Large)** → $25  

2. The user decides whether to add **pepperoni**:  
   - +$2 for Small pizzas  
   - +$3 for Medium or Large pizzas  

3. The user chooses whether to add **extra cheese**:  
   - +$1 for any size  

4. The final bill is displayed.
